# TypingMaster_Game

Our Speed Typing Master Game consists of two modes:

**1. Solo Mode** - It is working good having a timer, WPM calculation, and random data is also fetched to type. 
If we typed the wrong word then it shows red and correct word with green, with difficulty level. 
**Solo Mode is working good**

**2. Multi Mode** - In Multimode Player, we have two buttons, one for Creating Game ie. creating Lobby and another to Join
the lobby through special ID created by the **CreateGame Button**. This is not completed, facing issues with socket.io connection 
and displaying the timer. Multimode is not completed.
